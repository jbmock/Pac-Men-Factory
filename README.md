# Pac-Men-Factory
Description: This project taught me how to control the DOM by adding Pac-Men characters to the screen and having them move back and forth with just the click of a couple buttons. I utilized some array methods that I have been learning such as array.push.

How to run: Load the index.html file in your browser and click the "Make PacMan" button. Once you have the desired number of PacMen on your screen, click the "Start Game" button and watch them all start to move across your screen.

Future improvements: I will implement more CSS by adding a background color. I will also implement more JS by having the Pac-Men images change direction each time window detection is activated.
